# Guess_mypassword

## WHAT I DID 

* I needed to create Vars with arrays to add characters and use the for loop and if statements.
* Also added new things that we werent taught to my password generator like adding += to replace concat and shortend the array.
and adding toLocaleUpperCase to add uppercase letters and that elimates a new array of upper case letters. So in end i was able to create 1 var with an array. 
* Also an alert or prompt to ask the user what they would want in the password.
